# Project Abstact: Farmers, Fertilizers, and Farming (F3)

The agricultural sector plays a crucial role in ensuring food security and sustaining economies worldwide. The **"Farmers, Fertilizers, and Farming (F3)"** project seeks to bridge the gap between fertilizer manufacturers, and farmers by establishing an e-commerce platform dedicated to delivering high-quality fertilizers directly to the farming community.

This project focuses on creating a web application for farmers and fertilization management, with two types of users: the **admin** **(Manufacturer)** and the **user** **(Customers)**. The admin has the privilege to add fertilizers to the system, while the regular user can view the available fertilizers, add them to the cart, and proceed with the payment.

The web application consists of two main pages: the user homepage and the admin homepage. The admin homepage allows the admin user to add new fertilizers to the system, providing relevant details such as product name, description, price.

On the user homepage, users can view the available fertilizers and add them to their cart. The cart keeps track of the selected products, and users can see the total amount of their purchases.

The payment page offers various options for users to complete their purchase. Users can choose _cash on delivery_, make a payment via _UPI_, or use _net banking_. When the user selects the UPI option, a QR code is displayed to make the payment for the purchase.

Once the payment is completed, an invoice is automatically generated in _PDF_ format. The invoice includes the details of the purchased products, the total amount, and any other relevant information. Users can download and save the PDF invoice.

Overall, this web application simplifies the fertilization management process for farmers, allowing them to view and purchase fertilizers conveniently, while providing the admin with the capability to add and remove products to the system.
